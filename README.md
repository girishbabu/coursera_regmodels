Regression Models Assignment as part of the Coursera Program

## Executive summary

As part of the Coursera assignment on Regression models, I will try to address the following 2 objectives - 

- "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?"
- "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

Use the `mtcars` dataset from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and performed few Statistical Inference Tests and a corresponding Regression Analysis. Statistical Inference Tests show a difference in mean of about 7 miles more for the manual transmitted cars. Regression Analysis indicates, given that weight and 1/4 mile time are held constant, Manual transmission cars are (14.079 - 4.141 * weight mpg) better than Automatic Transmission cars on average and also that this result is significant. Conclusion is that lighter cars are better off with a Manual transmission, but heavier cars are better off with Automatic transmission.
